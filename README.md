# Life_Expectancy_Dashboard
Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health. Based on 
that I have collected data and tried to evaluate these figures in form of Line 
chart in which we can set range (year) and compare growth among different 
countries. For this I have used the following libraries of python:
✓ Dash
✓ Plotly
✓ Pandas
